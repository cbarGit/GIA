GIF IT ALL
==========

####It is an app based on `electron` that search instantly gifs every time you type a character in the field.

Inspired by this woman **Mary Rose Cook**, from this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8vLt5AB2TI

It uses the giphy API, the public beta one, from here:
> https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI .

The font used in the app:
https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/futura-renner

Next steps:
- Add a context menu for saving gif. --> **done**.
- Figure out a better download of gif, now it is limited to 10 gifs. --> **done**. No more limited, there is a spinbox.
